1. Describe how the assembly changes with different k-mer values using the
assembly statistics you have collected. How does the contig length distribution change?

As kmer size increases you see a decrease in assembly length, and increase in
mean contig size, a decrease in the number of contigs, and an increase in N50 value.
Coverage seems to remain relatively similar between all assemblies. Interestingly,
the max contig length was achieved with a kmer size of 41. The contig distribution
seems to increase as you increase kmer size which makes sense in light of the
other statistics.

2. How does an increased coverage cutoff affect the assembly? What is happening
to the de Bruijin graph when you change the value of this parameter? How does
velvet calculate its value for ‘auto’?

Increasing coverage cutoff decreased the number of contigs, decreased the size of the assembly,
but did increase the mean contig and the mean depth of coverage. Increasing the coverage
increases the number of edges that the de Bruijin graph has to visit. Velvet calculates
auto by determining half of the length weighted median contig depth.

3. How does increasing minimum contig length affect your contig length distribution and N50?
It appears to improve both statistics drastically, however it did decrease
assembly size by 40% compared to the kmer of 49 assembly without specified coverage.
There were also significantly less contigs.
